/**
 * A TradeMessageStore is taking care of storing trade messages for later use,
 * for instance for matching purposes. It acts as an ERP or database system for
 * the supply chain actor. In this implementation, all the messages are linked
 * to an InternalDemand, as this sets off the whole chain of messages, no matter
 * whether it is a purchase, internal production, or stock replenishment: in all
 * cases the InternalDemand triggers all the other messages.
