/**
 * A TradeMessageStore is taking care of storing trade messages for later use, for instance for matching purposes. It acts as an
 * ERP or database system for the supply chain actor. In this implementation, all the messages are linked to an InternalDemand,
 * as this sets off the whole chain of messages, no matter whether it is a purchase, internal production, or stock
 * replenishment: in all cases the InternalDemand triggers all the other messages.
