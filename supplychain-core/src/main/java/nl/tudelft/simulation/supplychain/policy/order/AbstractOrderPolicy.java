/**
 * The OrderHandler contains the business logic for handling an incoming Order. It will send out a positive or negative
 * confirmation, based on the conditions at the firm at the moment when the order is received. In its most basic form, the Order
 * will put a claim on finished goods in the store of the owner, and schedule the release of these goods. The sending of the
 * bill has also to be decided here. All in all, the OrderHandler is one of the most complex handlers, because it involves a
 * number of different content types and a lot of possible parameters. <br>
 * In general, when an Order comes in, it puts a claim on the stock of that product (make to stock), or it is specifically
 * fabricated for that order (make to order). Both are implemented as a separate subclass as can differ considerably. When the
 * fabrication or reservation is successful, an OrderConfirmation is sent, and the process continues. When not, a negative
 * OrderConfirmation is sent and the process stops. <br>
 * After that, the transportation has to be arranged or the transportation time has to be calculated. At the agreed delivery
 * time minus the transportation time, the order is picked immediately (or as soon as it is available), and sent as a Shipment
 * to the other actor. <br>
 * A bill is sent out before, with, or after the shipment, and in some cases, the shipment has to wait for the payment to
 * arrive.
