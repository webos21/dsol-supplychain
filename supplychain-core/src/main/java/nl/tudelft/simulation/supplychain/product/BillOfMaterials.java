/**
 * The BillOfMaterials is a list of products and amounts that are needed to make
 * one SKU of a given product. The BillOfMaterials is used in the simulation of
 * manufacturing processes to be able to pick the right materials in the right
 * quantities to make a new product. The amounts in the BillOfMaterials are
 * related to producing one SKU of the product to which it belongs, so if the
 * Unit is a Unit.CONTAINER20FT, the amounts in the BillOfMaterials (in their
 * own SKUs) indicate the quantities needed to produce one 20 ft container load
 * of end product.
