/**
 * The BillOfMaterials is a list of products and amounts that are needed to make one SKU of a given product. The BillOfMaterials
 * is used in the simulation of manufacturing processes to be able to pick the right materials in the right quantities to make a
 * new product. The amounts in the BillOfMaterials are related to producing one SKU of the product to which it belongs, so if
 * the Unit is a Unit.CONTAINER20FT, the amounts in the BillOfMaterials (in their own SKUs) indicate the quantities needed to
 * produce one 20 ft container load of end product.
